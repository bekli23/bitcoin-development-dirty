ðŸ‘€ Hi, I'm a normal person and for about 3 years I've learned a lot about cryptography and cryptocurrencies. <br>
ðŸ‘€Normally you will say that it is not possible for me to do this project.<br>
ðŸ‘€In the first part I will make a major change in bitcoin core ,basically I want to stop signing transactions only with private key.<br>

ðŸŒ± Attention !!!!!!! this is an experimental project so don't put your real wallet with money !!!
